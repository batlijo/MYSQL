will's walk through
const connectObject = {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,
  user: " ",
  password: " ",
  database: "ice_creamDB"
}

const mySql = require("mysql")
const conn = mySql.createConnection(connectObject)

think about what piece of your application is responsible for what things
an event takes off when a connection is made and will return something

connection.connect(function(error){
  if (error){
    throw error
  }

  console.log("Connected as ID: ${connection.threadID}")
})
